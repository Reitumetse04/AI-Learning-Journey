# How I Handled Challenges – Week 1

Despite the challenges in Week 1, I focused on learning how to push through difficulties rather than giving up.

## Breaking Problems Down
When a problem felt too big, I broke it down into smaller steps and focused on solving one part at a time.

## Practice and Repetition
I rewrote code multiple times and practiced simple exercises until the concepts became clearer.

## Using Errors as Feedback
Instead of getting discouraged by errors, I started reading error messages carefully to understand what went wrong.

## Asking for Help and Researching
I used documentation, searched for explanations online, and asked questions when I was stuck.

## Staying Consistent
Even on days when motivation was low, I made sure to code something small to maintain consistency.
