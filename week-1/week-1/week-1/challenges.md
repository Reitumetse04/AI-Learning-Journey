# Challenges Faced – Week 1

Week 1 was exciting but also challenging. These are some of the difficulties I faced:

## Understanding Programming Logic
Sometimes I knew what I wanted the program to do, but I struggled to translate that idea into code.

## Syntax Errors
Small mistakes like missing colons, incorrect indentation, or spelling errors caused my programs to break.

## Feeling Overwhelmed
At times, learning Python and AI concepts at the same time felt overwhelming, especially when new terms were introduced quickly.

## Debugging Code
When my code did not work, it was not always clear why, which led to frustration.
