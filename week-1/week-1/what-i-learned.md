# What I Learned – Week 1

During the first week of my AI learning challenge, I focused on building a strong foundation in Python and understanding basic AI concepts.

## Python Fundamentals
I learned:
- How to declare and use variables
- Basic data types such as integers, strings, floats, and booleans
- How to use conditional statements (if, else, elif)
- How loops work (for loops and while loops)
- How to write and use functions
- Basic error handling using try and except

## Programming Concepts
- Breaking problems into smaller steps
- Writing cleaner and more readable code
- Understanding how logic flows in a program

## AI & Machine Learning Concepts
- What Artificial Intelligence is
- The difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- What datasets are and how data is used to train models
- Real-world examples of machine learning applications

This week helped me understand that AI is built on basic programming concepts and problem-solving skills, not magic.
